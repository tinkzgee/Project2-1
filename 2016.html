<h2> Congratulations on the successful XI ISUD World Congress hosted by the Polish Academy of Sciences, the University of Warsaw, and the Philosophy for Dialogue Foundation!</h2> 

<p> The 2016 XI ISUD World Congress was conducted as a celebration of the Society’s founding twenty-eight years ago in Warsaw. The Congress featured a geographically and culturally diverse group of scholars representing 39 countries from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island nations. Approximately 145 scholars attended and presented original research at the Congress.  A spirit of good will and eagerness to engage in and cultivate inter-cultural philosophical dialogue pervaded the dynamics of the meeting. </p>
